Github for collaboration

## Ways for collaborating on Github:
### 1. Issues
GitHub Issues, which is a robust way of creating documented, interactive, automated conversations about bugs or features for any given project. While Issues can be disabled, they are enabled by default. There are a lot of awesome features that Issues has built-in, but one of the most important features is its integration with pull requests. A user can reference an issue in their commit message by simply including the issue's numerical ID in the commit message. For instance:
```
git commit -am "Adding a header; fixes #3"
```
