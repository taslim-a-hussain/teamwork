Github for collaboration

## Ways for collaborating on Github:
### 1. Issues
GitHub Issues, which is a robust way of creating documented, interactive, automated conversations about bugs or features for any given project. While Issues can be disabled, they are enabled by default. There are a lot of awesome features that Issues has built-in, but one of the most important features is its integration with pull requests. A user can reference an issue in their commit message by simply including the issue's numerical ID in the commit message. For instance:
```
git commit -am "Adding a header; fixes #3"
```

### 2. Pull Request
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

After initializing a pull request, you'll see a review page that shows a high-level overview of the changes between your branch (the compare branch) and the repository's base branch. You can add a summary of the proposed changes, review the changes made by commits, add labels, milestones, and assignees, and @mention individual contributors or teams.

## Collaborating with issues and pull requests
Use the GitHub flow to track and discuss changes in issues, then propose and review changes in pull requests.
### GitHub flow
#### Following the GitHub flow
1. Create a branch from the repository.
2. Create, edit, rename, move, or delete files.
3. Send a pull request from your branch with your proposed changes to kick off a discussion.
4. Make changes on your branch as needed. Your pull request will update automatically.
5. Merge the pull request once the branch is ready to be merged.
6. Tidy up your branches using the delete button in the pull request or on the branches page.
